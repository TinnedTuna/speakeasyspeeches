SpeakEasy Speeches Todo List
============================

  1. Ensure menu appears on _all_ pages
    - There is at least one "post-login" failure screen that needs this.
  2. Full-Text search
  3. Contact Page
  4. Styling
    - We have no scroll bar for long pages. What is up with that?
  5. Blog stuff:
    - Styling for the titles, on both view-long form, and overview
    - Add a "New Post" button on the overview screen for authenticated users.
    - Add an "Edit Post" button on the view screen of non-authenticated users.
    - Maybe, preview button on the edit/create screen?
  6. Ensure that admin controls only show for authenticated users.
  7. Refactor into Blueprints (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/blueprints)

  10. Signout button.
  11. SSL
  12. Domain name (CNAME?) stuff?
